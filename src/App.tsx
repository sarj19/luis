            My journey began with writing performances intended for live
            audiences. The world of magic instantly captivated me, igniting a
            deep love for the art form. I knew that magic was my calling. It
            consumes my thoughts day and night, and I am rarely seen without a
            deck of cards in my hands.

            Earning the esteemed title of the finest sleight of hand artist in
            Nepal, I have also been entrusted with the honor of leading the
            Nepali Brotherhood of Magicians, the sole magician's organization in
            Nepal. This responsibility instilled in me a deep sense of duty
            towards the future of magic and live shows in Nepal.

            With extensive experience, including in TV, I continually push the
            boundaries of magic to create unforgettable moments. Join me on this
            enchanting journey to witness the wonder and magic I bring to every
            performance. Together, let's EXPERIENCE THE IMPOSSIBLE and create a
