        My journey began with writing performances intended for live audiences.
        The world of magic instantly captivated me, igniting a deep love for the
        art form. I knew that magic was my calling. It consumes my thoughts day
        and night, and I am rarely seen without a deck of cards in my hands.

        Earning the esteemed title of the finest sleight of hand artist in
        Nepal, I have also been entrusted with the honor of leading the Nepali
        Brotherhood of Magicians, the sole magician's organization in Nepal.
        This responsibility instilled in me a deep sense of duty towards the
        future of magic and live shows in Nepal.

        With extensive experience, including in TV, I continually push the
        boundaries of magic to create unforgettable moments. Join me on this
        enchanting journey to witness the wonder and magic I bring to every
        performance. Together, let's EXPERIENCE THE IMPOSSIBLE and create a legacy
        in the world of magic.
